/* This pass promotes reads from uniforms from load/store ops to uniform
 * registers if it is beneficial to do so. Normally, this saves both
 * instructions and total register pressure, but it does take a toll on the
 * number of work registers that are available, so this is a balance.
 *
 * To cope, we take as an argument the maximum work register pressure in the
 * program so we allow that many registers through at minimum, to prevent
 * spilling. If we spill anyway, I mean, it's a lose-lose at that point. */
