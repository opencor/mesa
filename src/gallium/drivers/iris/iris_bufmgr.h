/**
 * Memory zones.  When allocating a buffer, you can request that it is
 * placed into a specific region of the virtual address space (PPGTT).
 *
 * Most buffers can go anywhere (IRIS_MEMZONE_OTHER).  Some buffers are
 * accessed via an offset from a base address.  STATE_BASE_ADDRESS has
 * a maximum 4GB size for each region, so we need to restrict those
 * buffers to be within 4GB of the base.  Each memory zone corresponds
 * to a particular base address.
 *
 * We lay out the virtual address space as follows:
 *
 * - [0,   4K): Nothing            (empty page for null address)
 * - [4K,  4G): Shaders            (Instruction Base Address)
 * - [4G,  8G): Surfaces & Binders (Surface State Base Address, Bindless ...)
 * - [8G, 12G): Dynamic            (Dynamic State Base Address)
 * - [12G, *):  Other              (everything else in the full 48-bit VMA)
 *
 * A special buffer for border color lives at the start of the dynamic state
 * memory zone.  This unfortunately has to be handled specially because the
 * SAMPLER_STATE "Indirect State Pointer" field is only a 24-bit pointer.
 *
 * Each GL context uses a separate GEM context, which technically gives them
 * each a separate VMA.  However, we assign address globally, so buffers will
 * have the same address in all GEM contexts.  This lets us have a single BO
 * field for the address, which is easy and cheap.
