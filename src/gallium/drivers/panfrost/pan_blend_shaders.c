/*
 * Implements the command stream portion of programmatic blend shaders.
 *
 * On Midgard, common blending operations are accelerated by the fixed-function
 * blending pipeline. Panfrost supports this fast path via the code in
 * pan_blending.c. Nevertheless, uncommon blend modes (including some seemingly
 * simple modes present in ES2) require "blend shaders", a special internal
 * shader type used for programmable blending.
 *
 * Blend shaders operate during the normal blending time, but they bypass the
 * fixed-function blending pipeline and instead go straight to the Midgard
 * shader cores. The shaders themselves are essentially just fragment shaders,
 * making heavy use of uint8 arithmetic to manipulate RGB values for the
 * framebuffer.
 *
 * As is typical with Midgard, shader binaries must be accompanied by
 * information about the first tag (ORed with the bottom nibble of address,
 * like usual) and work registers. Work register count is specified in the
 * blend descriptor, as well as in the coresponding fragment shader's work
 * count. This suggests that blend shader invocation is tied to fragment shader
 * execution.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * As for blend shaders, they use the standard ISA.
 *
 * The source pixel colour, including alpha, is preloaded into r0 as a vec4 of
 * float32.
 *
 * The destination pixel colour must be loaded explicitly via load/store ops.
 * TODO: Investigate.
 *
 * They use fragment shader writeout; however, instead of writing a vec4 of
 * float32 for RGBA encoding, we writeout a vec4 of uint8, using 8-bit imov
 * instead of 32-bit fmov. The net result is that r0 encodes a single uint32
 * containing all four channels of the color.  Accordingly, the blend shader
 * epilogue has to scale all four channels by 255 and then type convert to a
 * uint8.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Blend shaders hardcode constants. Naively, this requires recompilation each
 * time the blend color changes, which is a performance risk. Accordingly, we
 * 'cheat' a bit: instead of loading the constant, we compile a shader with a
 * dummy constant, exporting the offset to the immediate in the shader binary,
 * storing this generic binary and metadata in the CSO itself at CSO create
 * time.
 *
 * We then hot patch in the color into this shader at attachment / color change
 * time, allowing for CSO create to be the only expensive operation
 * (compilation).
